This master branch provides the code for four different binary image classfication algorithms to distinghuis between cats and dogs. The '.py' files contain the code for the Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Convolutional Neural Network and the biased Convolutional Neural Network. The '.h5' files contain the saved models for all the above mentioned algorithms. The 'GUIforAll.py' contains the code for the GUI where all saved models can be loaded to use the interface. The images are images used for the representation of the predicted category. The full data set of images used for the training, testing and evualtion of these models can be found on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog/data.
